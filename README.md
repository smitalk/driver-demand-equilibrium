A project analyzing driver–demand allocation using Python and SQL (D²E Framework)
In last-mile logistics, customer satisfaction hinges on timely, reliable, and cost-efficient service delivery. However, fluctuating demand patterns, uneven driver distribution, and attrition create persistent mismatches between supply (driver availability) and demand (delivery requests).

This project introduces a data-driven strategy and metric system to dynamically align drivers with demand hotspots through predictive analytics, operational interventions, and continuous optimization.
